# Scheduling-App
A scheduling application, including a makeshift database, made in excel.

In order to use this you will first need to go to the "DatabaseVarsAndMethods" module in the VBA editor (Alt + F11) and change the JOB_DATABASE_PATH and JOB_DATABASE_REFERENCE_PATH to the actual path of your instance of the database workbook.

If you feel like looking through the code, I recommend you download and instal the [Rubberduck plugin](https://rubberduckvba.com/). It allows for a seudo file structure and some other features.
